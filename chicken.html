    <h1>Instant Pot Chicken and Dumplings</h1>
    <img height="310" width="310" src="./images/chicken.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Instant Pot chicken and dumplings recipe provides the richness of a long-simmered chicken stew without the
        fuss of using a whole chicken. </p>
    <p>It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour buttermilk into dumpling mixture and stir until combined.</li>
        <li>While chicken is cooling, mash butter with flour in a small bowl to make a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
        <li>Make dumplings: Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or
            a pastry blender until mixture resembles the texture of cornmeal.</li>
    </ol>
